#+TITLE: Vagrant Westtoer UV

* Introduction
* Setup Instructions

This will require two components to be installed:
- VirtualBox - 
- Vagrant - https://www.vagrantup.com/

The following steps sjould be sufficient:

- *cd <Clone Directory>*
- *vagrant up* which will build the virtual machine (will take a while
  depending on environment/network speed).

  Note: This first time the VM is created, it is best to do a restart
  from scratch (reboot can be requird to finalise some installs).
  - *vagrant halt*
  - *vagrant up*

Then it should be possible to login to the vagrant machine try the 
examples.
